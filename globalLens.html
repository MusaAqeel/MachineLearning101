					<p>Some general trends can be observed in relation to  racial discrimination in the workplace. In many places around the world, people of minority groups often face discrimination in the workplace. This can be in the form of lower wages, fewer opportunities for promotion, or simply not being hired in the first place. Additionally, people of minority groups are often given jobs that are seen as less desirable, such as manual labor or cleaning positions. In some cases, minority groups may also be subjected to physical or verbal abuse from co-workers or supervisors. Discrimination against minority groups in the workplace is often perpetuated by a lack of understanding or knowledge about other cultures. Additionally, discrimination can be the result of prejudiced attitudes or beliefs about certain groups of people. In some cases, discrimination may also be the result of competition for jobs or resources.</p>
