									<p>There are a number of steps that can be taken to fight racial discrimination in the workplace. First and foremost, it is important to be aware of the problem and to understand the ways in which it manifests itself. Once this is understood, employees can be more vigilant in identifying discriminatory behavior and reporting it to management.

										There should also be clear policies in place that prohibit racial discrimination and provide a process for addressing complaints. These policies should be communicated to all employees, and management should be held accountable for enforcing them.
										
										Organizations should make a commitment to diversity and inclusion, which can help to prevent racial discrimination from happening in the first place. This can be done through training, hiring practices, and other initiatives that promote a more diverse and inclusive workplace.</p>

						<h2>Personal Thoughts</h2>
					</header>
					<p>I chose this social issue for this project as someone who is eager to adnvcae in the workforce there are challanges that I could face which many do everyday. I want to bring awareness to racial discrimation and underrepresentation in the tech industry. Its an industry I am highly intersted in joining in the future but before I can there are some things I want to see change. I designed, coded and wrote this website completely from scratch not only for the complexity factor but I wanted to put forth all my effort so someone like a software engineer or a similar role who works in tech can really appreciate not only the awarness to this topic but the work and dedication put to deliver the message #NoPlaceForRacialDiscrimination@theWorkplace</p>
