						<h1>What is Machine Learning?</h1>
					</header>
					<span class="image main"><img src="images/whatisML.jpg" alt="" /></span>
					<p>Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a
						branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify
						patterns and make predictions with minimal human intervention. Machine learning algorithms are
						used in a wide variety of applications, including email filtering, detection of network
						intruders, and computer vision. Machine learning enables computers to learn without being
						explicitly programmed. This is achieved by training the computer with data so that it can learn
						to recognize patterns. Machine learning is used in a variety of applications, such as email
						filtering, detection of fraudulent activity, and image recognition. Email filtering is one of
						the most common applications of machine learning. Spam filters use machine learning to identify
						and delete unwanted emails. To do this, they first need to be trained with a set of data that
						includes both spam and non-spam emails. The filter then uses this data to learn what
						characteristics make an email more likely to be spam. This enables it to identify and delete
						future spam emails without the need for human intervention. Fraud detection is another common
						application of machine learning. This is typically done by training a machine learning algorithm
						with a dataset of past fraud cases. The algorithm then learns to identify patterns that are
						indicative of fraud. This allows it to flag future cases of fraud so that they can be
						investigated. Image recognition is another area where machine learning is used. This is usually
						done with a neural network, which is a type of machine learning algorithm. Neural networks are
						trained with a dataset of images, and they learn to recognize patterns in the images.

					<h2>Example of ML</h2>
				</header>
				<p>
					One example of machine learning is a computer program that can learn to recognize patterns in data.
					For example, a program might be able to learn to identify faces in digital images. The program could
					be designed to learn from a dataset of images that contain faces and non-faces, and then use that
					knowledge to identify faces in new images.
					The machine learning algorithm would start by extracting features from the training images, such as
					the shapes of the faces and the relative positions of the eyes, nose, and mouth. It would then use
					those features to build a model of what a face looks like. The model would be tested on a set of
					test images, and the algorithm would be tweaked as needed to improve its performance. Once the
					algorithm is perfected, it can be deployed to automatically identify faces in new images.

					<h2>Supervised Learning</h2>
				</header>
				<p>Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithms learn from labelled training
					data. This means that there is a known set of input and output data that the algorithms can use to
					learn. The goal of supervised learning is to generalise from the training data so that the
					algorithms can make predictions on new data.

					<h2>Unsupervised Learning</h2>
				</header>
				<p>Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning algorithm that is used to find patterns in data.
					It is used to find hidden structures in data. It is used to cluster data points together.
				</p>
				<p><strong>Example: </strong>Let's say you have a dataset of images. Each image is represented by a
					vector of pixels. You can use an unsupervised learning algorithm to cluster the images together. The
					algorithm will group together images that are similar.

					<h2>Semi-Supervised Learning</h2>
				</header>
				<p>
					Semi-supervised learning is a subfield of machine learning that deals with using both labelled and
					unlabeled data to train models. This can be useful when there is not enough labelled data to train a
					model, but there is enough unlabeled data to provide useful information.

				</p>
				<p><strong>Example: </strong>Let's say we want to train a model to classify images as containing either
					a dog or a cat. We have a dataset of images, but only some of them are labelled with their class
					(dog or cat). We can use a semi-supervised learning approach to use both the labelled and unlabelled
					data to train a model that is more accurate than if we had only used the labelled data.

					<li><strong>Association mining: </strong>Identifying sets of items in a data set that frequently

					<h2>Reinforced Learning</h2>
				</header>
				<p>
					Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning that is concerned with how software agents
					ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximise some notion of cumulative reward.


				</p>
				<p><strong>Example: </strong>A robot is placed in a room with a goal of cleaning up as much of the room
					as possible. The robot has a limited amount of time and battery life, so it must decide how to best
					use its resources in order to clean up as much of the room as possible. The robot uses reinforcement
					learning in order to learn how best to clean the room.

					<li><strong>Video Gameplay: </strong>Reinforcement learning has been used to teach bots to play a
						number of video games.

					</li>

					<li><strong>Resource Management: </strong> Given finite resources and a defined goal, reinforcement
						learning can help enterprises plan out how to allocate resources.

					<h2>Decision Trees</h2>
				</header>
				<p>

					A decision tree is a graphical representation of a set of conditions used to determine a course of
					action. In machine learning, decision trees are used to predict the output of a given input. The
					tree is constructed by starting at the root node and working down to the leaves. The leaves
					represent the final decision, and the branches represent the conditions that lead to that
					decision.The advantage of using a decision tree is that it can be used to represent a complex
					decision process in a simple and easy to understand format. Decision trees can be used for both
					classification and regression tasks. In classification, the tree is used to predict a class label,
					and in regression, the tree is used to predict a numeric value. Decision trees are a powerful tool
					for machine learning, but they are not without their limitations. One of the main limitations is
					that decision trees can be very sensitive to small changes in the data. This can lead to
					overfitting, where the model learns the noise in the data rather than the true signal. Another
					limitation of decision trees is that they can be difficult to interpret. This is because the
					decision tree is a black box model, meaning that it is difficult to understand how the model is
					making its predictions. Despite their limitations, decision trees are a popular choice for machine
					learning tasks, and they can be very effective when used properly.
