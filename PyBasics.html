								<h2>Discrimination and Underrepresentation.</h2>
							</header>
							<p>If you look at the worlds largest and wealthiest companies Apple Inc falls second after oil tycoon Saudi Armco with a value of 2.223 Trillion and Microsoft coming in third. 2 of 3 of the companies mentioned are tech companies. They create hardware and software that advance the tech we use on a day to day basis that can improve each one of our lives. However there can be a problem when racial discrimination and underrepresentation occur in these workplaces. There is a long history of racial discrimination in the tech industry. Black and Latino workers have been systematically excluded from good jobs and opportunities in the field. This has led to a lack of diversity in the industry, which in turn has contributed to a lack of understanding and awareness of the needs of black and Latino consumers. As a result, products and services are often designed without consideration for the unique perspectives and experiences of these groups. This can have a negative impact on the ability of black and Latino people to access and use technology. It can also lead to a feeling of isolation and exclusion from the industry as a whole.</p>

								<h2>Why does Representation Matter?</h2>
							</header>
							<p>After it was discovered that Amazon's recruiting algorithm favoured men's résumés over women's, the company decided to scrap it. Researchers discovered that a courtroom sentencing algorithm was more forgiving toward white people than black ones. According to a study, mortgage algorithms favour Latino and African American borrowers. There needs to be a fair represnetaion of all races in the workplace espailly in tech as its the industry that controlls billions of people daily activiities. If you just think about it how, everything that you use on a day to day basisi takes engineering and coding.</p>

									<h2>Racial Bias in Software</h2>
								</header>
								<p>There is a problem with racial bias in machine learning algorithms, especially facial recognition systems. This is due to the fact that these systems are trained on imbalanced datasets, with more data from one race than another. This can lead to error rates of up to 34% for dark-skinned women, while light-skinned males have errors of around 0.8%. To fix this issue, more data from other races needs to be added to the dataset. However, this may make training the model take a lot longer and worsen the performance for other racial groups.</p>

									<h2>Racial Discrimnation in Machine Learning (Healthcare)</h2>
								</header>
								<p>In software systems, racial bias can have disastrous repercussions. Predictive models in healthcare are the perpetrators of healthcare injustice. According to reports, hospitals and insurers utilised a prediction technology called Optum that denied many black people access to high-risk care management. 
									However, this model was not intended to be racially discriminatory; Optum did not consider race as a component. It simply looked at cost as a metric. According to data, black people cost $1,800 less in medical costs per year than white patients with the same number of chronic health issues. As a result, the model favoured white patients because they would benefit more. Furthermore, when black and white patients spent the same amount of money, black patients had more pressing requirements. They spent more on active interventions like emergency visits for serious illnesses. Optum's approach prioritised white patients, who were more expensive but healthier than black ones. 
									The model's lack of race awareness reinforces systemic racial inequity in the healthcare system, and hospitals, unfortunately, are not treating the sickest individuals. They are only treating white, wealthy people.</p>

										<h2>What are Tech Companies Doing?</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Some companies are beginning to take steps to address racial discrimination in the tech industry. For example, Google has implemented a number of initiatives to increase diversity among its workforce. These include unconscious bias training for all employees, hiring quotas for underrepresented groups, and creating a more diverse leadership team. Other companies are also beginning to take similar steps. However, much more needs to be done in order to truly address the problem. The current CEO of google, Sundar Pichai has made a stamtnet that goes against the policy of interagating Google and Alpahebt employees when entering buliindg. This has come due to an major increase in the number of people of colour getting stopped to verify their employment at facilities or offices. </p>
